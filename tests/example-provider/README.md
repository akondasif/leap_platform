# Run LEAP provider locally with Vagrant

You can use Vagrant to start a pre-configured example provider.
This virtual provider includes only a single node.
See [LEAP Vagrant documentation](https://leap.se/en/docs/platform/tutorials/vagrant) for more
details.

All you have to do is this:

    cd leap_platform/tests/example-provider
    vagrant up
